# ðŸ§  Scalability First Vs Feature First

Choosing between **Scalability-First** and **Feature-First** approaches affects how you prioritize development.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Scalability-First

- Prioritize system performance, architecture, and future growth
- Ideal for high-traffic startups or systems expected to scale rapidly

## ðŸ“Œ Feature-First

- Focus on delivering product features quickly
- Iterate based on user feedback, optimize later

---

## ðŸ§  Use Cases

- Feature-First: MVPs, startups validating an idea
- Scalability-First: Infrastructure-heavy products or mature systems

---

## ðŸ›  Recommended Tools

- Feature Toggles (LaunchDarkly)
- Auto-scaling Infra (Kubernetes, AWS Fargate)
- Load Testing (Locust, k6)
