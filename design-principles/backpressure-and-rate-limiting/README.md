# ðŸ§  Backpressure And Rate Limiting

**Backpressure** is the ability of a system to signal upstream systems to slow down. **Rate Limiting** restricts the number of operations to avoid overload.

---

## ðŸ§° How to Use

- Apply rate limits on APIs per user/IP/token
- Use queues and monitor throughput
- Reject or throttle requests when thresholds are exceeded

---

## ðŸ§  Use Cases

- Public APIs and gateways
- Stream processing pipelines
- Microservice communication

---

## ðŸ›  Recommended Tools

- NGINX, Envoy, or API Gateway rate limiting
- Kafka (backpressure by design)
- Redis or Token Bucket algorithms
