# ðŸ§  Idempotency And Consistency Guarantees

**Idempotency** ensures multiple identical requests have the same effect as one. **Consistency Guarantees** define how up-to-date and synchronized the data is.

---

## ðŸ§° How to Use

- Use idempotency keys for APIs (e.g., payment requests)
- Choose consistency model: Strong, Eventual, or Causal
- Use distributed locks where needed

---

## ðŸ§  Use Cases

- APIs (e.g., POST /order)
- Distributed databases or caches
- Systems requiring reliability under retries

---

## ðŸ›  Recommended Tools

- Redis for atomic operations
- Apache Zookeeper for coordination
- Databases: Cassandra (Eventual), PostgreSQL (Strong)
