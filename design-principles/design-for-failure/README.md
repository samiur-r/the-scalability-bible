# ðŸ§  Design For Failure

**Designing for Failure** means building systems that expect and gracefully handle failures rather than assuming they won't happen.

---

## ðŸ§° How to Use

- Introduce retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers
- Use redundant systems and failovers
- Isolate failures with bulkheads and graceful degradation

---

## ðŸ§  Use Cases

- Distributed systems and microservices
- Systems with third-party dependencies
- Critical services requiring high uptime

---

## ðŸ›  Recommended Tools

- Resilience4j, Istio (Circuit Breaking)
- AWS Multi-AZ / GCP Load Balancing
- Chaos Engineering Tools (Gremlin, Chaos Monkey)

## ðŸ’¬ Conclusion

Design principles guide how systems are built and evolve. Understanding the trade-offs and patterns helps you make smarter architectural choices that align with your goals.
