# ðŸ§  Trade Offs

System design involves **trade-offs** between competing concerns like latency, throughput, consistency, and availability.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Common Trade-offs

- **Latency vs Throughput**: Fast response vs handling more requests
- **Consistency vs Availability**: (CAP Theorem) â€“ pick 2 of 3 (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)
- **Speed vs Accuracy**: ML systems, search results

---

## ðŸ§° How to Use

- Prioritize based on business goals
- Identify critical paths and acceptable risks
- Document design decisions and revisit regularly

---

## ðŸ§  Use Cases

- Eventual consistency for high availability
- Strong consistency for financial transactions
- High throughput for logging or telemetry systems

---

## ðŸ›  Recommended Tools

- Event Sourcing, CQRS
- Apache Kafka, Cassandra
- RDBMS for transactional consistency
