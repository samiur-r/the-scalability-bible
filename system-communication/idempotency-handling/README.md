# ðŸ”„ Idempotency Handling

Idempotency ensures that repeating the same operation has no additional effect, critical for reliable APIs and distributed systems.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Why It Matters

Efficient and reliable service communication is key to building scalable and resilient distributed systems.

---

## âœ… Best Practices

- Use asynchronous messaging to decouple services
- Handle retries and failures gracefully
- Use service discovery for dynamic routing
- Choose REST or gRPC based on latency and payload needs
- Ensure idempotency for reliability
- Apply appropriate patterns for transactions and delivery guarantees

---

## ðŸ›  Recommended Tools

- **Messaging**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS
- **Communication**: REST, gRPC, WebSockets
- **Service Discovery**: Consul, Eureka
- **Patterns**: Saga, Outbox
