# ðŸš€ Blue Green And Canary Deployments

**Blue-Green** and **Canary** deployments reduce deployment risk by releasing new versions gradually.

---

## ðŸ§° How to Use

- Blue-Green: Run two environments (Blue=Live, Green=New), switch traffic when ready
- Canary: Release to a small % of users, then increase gradually

---

## ðŸ§  Use Cases

- Safe rollback in case of failure
- Test in production with limited impact
- Continuous delivery with minimal downtime
