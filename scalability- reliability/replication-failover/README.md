# 🔁 Replication & Failover: Ensuring Data Availability and Reliability

**Replication and failover** are critical techniques used in distributed systems and databases to ensure **high availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **disaster recovery**.

---

## 📌 What is Replication?

Replication is the process of copying data from one database/server (the **primary**) to one or more **replicas** (also called secondaries, slaves, or followers).

---

## 🎯 Why Use Replication?

- ✅ High Availability: Keep your service running if one server fails
- 🔄 Redundancy: Protect against data loss
- 📖 Read Scaling: Distribute read traffic across replicas
- 🛡️ Disaster Recovery: Backup and restore from replicas

---

## 🧠 Types of Replication

| Type             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Master-Slave** | One primary server handles writes; replicas sync and serve reads |
| **Master-Master**| Multiple servers can handle writes; conflicts must be managed |
| **Asynchronous** | Replicas lag slightly behind the primary (better performance) |
| **Synchronous**  | All writes are acknowledged only after replicas confirm (strong consistency) |

---

## ⚙️ What is Failover?

Failover is the **automatic switch** from a failed primary node to a replica that takes over, minimizing downtime.

Failover mechanisms detect failure and promote a replica to become the new primary.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Data is written to the primary node
2. The primary replicates that data to secondary nodes
3. If the primary goes down:
   - Failover is triggered
   - A secondary is promoted to primary
   - Services are rerouted to the new primary

## 🧱 Real-World Implementations

| Technology     | Replication Type     | Built-in Failover? |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| PostgreSQL     | Master-Slave (Streaming Replication) | With tools like Patroni |
| MySQL          | Master-Slave / Master-Master         | With tools like MHA or Orchestrator |
| MongoDB        | Replica Sets                          | Yes |
| Redis          | Master-Slave                          | Sentinel for failover |
| Cassandra      | Peer-to-peer replication              | Yes (eventual consistency) |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Monitor replication lag and health
- Use **read-only replicas** for scaling read traffic
- Automate failover with tools like:
  - **Patroni** for PostgreSQL
  - **Sentinel** for Redis
  - **Orchestrator** for MySQL
- Consider **quorum-based writes** for consistency
- Keep backups even with replication — it's not a substitute!

---

## ⚠️ Challenges

- Replication lag (especially in async setups)
- Conflict resolution in master-master replication
- Failover split-brain scenarios if not handled correctly
- Latency between regions in geo-replication

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Patroni**: HA for PostgreSQL
- **Redis Sentinel**: Auto failover for Redis
- **MySQL Orchestrator**: Topology and failover management
- **Etcd / ZooKeeper**: Coordination in distributed systems
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL offer managed failover

## 💬 Conclusion

Replication and failover are essential for keeping your systems running — even when things go wrong. By designing for **redundancy**, **automation**, and **monitoring**, you build systems that are resilient, scalable, and production-ready.
