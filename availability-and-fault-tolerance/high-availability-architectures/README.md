# ⚙️ High Availability Architectures

**High Availability (HA)** refers to systems that are continuously operational for a long time, minimizing downtime. HA architectures ensure there's no single point of failure.

---

## 🧰 How to Use

- Deploy across multiple availability zones or regions
- Use load balancers to route traffic
- Implement auto-failover mechanisms

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Web apps requiring 24/7 uptime
- Financial or healthcare systems
- Systems needing SLA guarantees

---

## 🛠 Recommended Tools

- AWS Multi-AZ, Route 53, ELB
- GCP Global Load Balancing
- Azure Traffic Manager

## 💬 Conclusion

Building resilient systems means planning for failure. Use redundancy, fault tolerance patterns, and chaos engineering to ensure your system continues to perform under stress.
