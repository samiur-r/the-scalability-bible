# ⚙️ Circuit Breaker Pattern

The **Circuit Breaker Pattern** prevents a system from repeatedly trying an operation likely to fail, helping to maintain responsiveness.

---

## 🧰 How to Use

- Wrap external service calls with a circuit breaker
- Trip the circuit after a threshold of failures
- Reset after a cooldown period

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Prevent cascading failures
- Isolate faulty microservices
- Improve system fault tolerance

---

## 🛠 Recommended Tools

- Resilience4j
- Hystrix (deprecated but still used)
- Istio, Envoy

## 💬 Conclusion

Building resilient systems means planning for failure. Use redundancy, fault tolerance patterns, and chaos engineering to ensure your system continues to perform under stress.
