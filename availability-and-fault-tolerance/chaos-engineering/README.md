# ⚙️ Chaos Engineering

**Chaos Engineering** involves deliberately injecting failures into a system to test resilience and recovery processes.

---

## 🧰 How to Use

- Define steady state and monitor it
- Introduce random failures or latency
- Observe and improve system behavior

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Validate incident response
- Discover unknown failure modes
- Improve reliability and confidence in production

---

## 🛠 Recommended Tools

- Gremlin
- Chaos Monkey (Netflix)
- LitmusChaos, Chaos Mesh

## 💬 Conclusion

Building resilient systems means planning for failure. Use redundancy, fault tolerance patterns, and chaos engineering to ensure your system continues to perform under stress.
