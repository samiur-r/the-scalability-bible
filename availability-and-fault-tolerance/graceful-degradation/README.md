# ⚙️ Graceful Degradation

**Graceful Degradation** allows a system to remain functional at a reduced level instead of failing completely.

---

## 🧰 How to Use

- Provide fallback content or features
- Use cached or last-known-good data
- Inform users of limited availability

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Partial outages in microservices
- UI/UX resilience during backend issues
- Third-party service failure

---

## 🛠 Recommended Tools

- Feature Flags (LaunchDarkly, Unleash)
- CDN with stale-while-revalidate
- Caching layers (Redis, Varnish)

## 💬 Conclusion

Building resilient systems means planning for failure. Use redundancy, fault tolerance patterns, and chaos engineering to ensure your system continues to perform under stress.
