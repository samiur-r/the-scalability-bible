# ⚙️ Redundancy And Failover Planning

**Redundancy** involves duplicating critical components or functions. **Failover** ensures a backup system takes over when the primary fails.

---

## 🧰 How to Use

- Maintain secondary instances for critical services
- Use automated failover scripts or cloud-native options
- Replicate databases in real-time

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Database clusters (e.g., master-slave)
- Load-balanced applications
- High-traffic e-commerce systems

---

## 🛠 Recommended Tools

- AWS RDS Multi-AZ
- PostgreSQL Streaming Replication
- Keepalived, Pacemaker

## 💬 Conclusion

Building resilient systems means planning for failure. Use redundancy, fault tolerance patterns, and chaos engineering to ensure your system continues to perform under stress.
